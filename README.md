###### Football
I like football because it helps to build stamina strength and speed. It is dealt with teamwork and also individual's role. It boosts **confidence**. It is exciting to watch and competitive. It deals with time management. It improves bone-strength, co-ordination. It is **controlling ball with foot** and scoring goals which makes me feel more excited and curious to watch.
